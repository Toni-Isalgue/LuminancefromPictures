# LuminancefromPictures
Obtain surface luminancies (in cd/m2) from digital pictures

Explanation of uses of the program (c++ script) Lumi

Program Lumi - after fjnn -  from program fotoj3 based on judi based on old programs Judit, and Jcolor2 (see PhD Judit Lopez-Besora)
weights parts of bmp picture and finds average partial luminances and deviations, Toni Isalgue and Judit Lopez-Besora, 2025
Previous:  modification /08/2016 produce grayscale with luminances. modification /01/2018 to introduce 3 pictures as HDR (high-definition range)
suggerence 5-9 steps in grey picture for luminances     modification: Feb 2018 scales of grey modified
March 2018: give info for colours, all and parts of picture
October 2024  simplified  October 2024, 3 rectangles, and write down averages for the rectangles (R G B, L) and standard deviations. Final plot of Luminances improved

This is a "research" application. The results depend on appropriate calibration (with a luminance meter). Also, might depend on kind of digital camera. Actual values were appropriate for a CANON EOS 250 camera saving pictures as .jpg files (using s-RGB colour space) and converted to bmp with Windows Paint, Photoshop, or Ubuntu Pinta programs.
The software is provided “as is” with no guaranties,, the authors are not responsible for inaccuracies, inappropriate use or any mis-interpretation of results. Intended for educational, non-commercial and research purposes. The users are expected to have criteria for adequate use.

Luminance of digital pictures. Needs pictures in non-compressed, s-rgb coded, bmp format .bmp as input:
Picture files:          dib1.bmp Where ASA/ISO, Exposition, Aperture are given. Can be obtained from the EXIF heading                             that most cameras give for .jpg files, through: Properties (in Windows explorer) -> Details 
                        (in the EXIF heading of the picture)
                        dib2.bmp Less exposition, recommended -2 stops
                        dib3.bmp More exposition, recommended +2 stops
Remember: The 3 bmp pictures need to be: Well aligned, non-compressed, s-rgb colours, and of the same width, height.
Can be obtained from .jpg files many cameras produce, convert to .bmp with Windows Paint, or Photoshop or similar 

Numerical file (in ascii) input.dat Contents:
Line1:   C1, integer, 0 normal processing reads ISO/ASA, Aperture Exposition
Line2:   C2, integer, stops between pictures ('bracketing')
Line3:   C3, integer, number of luminance bands (recommended 5-7)

Line5:   C5c float, value of gamma compression  (if 0, takes 2.2 as default)
Line6:   if C1=0, ISO/ASA  of picture dib1.bmp (example: 200)
Line7:   if C1=0, Aperture of picture dib1.bmp (ex: if f/11, give: 11)
Line8:   if C1=0, Exposition     of   dib1.bmp (ex: if 1/320 s, give: 320)
Line9:   C9 integer ask for RGB values of C9 points (xl[], yl[]). 0 if not
Lines10-11*: xl[], yl[] C9 times 2 numbers (2*C9 files) (*if C9=0, omit) if C9>0 Attention bmp starts left down corner
3 times:
Lin12-13: xini, xefe: x start, x end, x define rectangle to find averages
Lin14-15: yini, yefe, y start, x end, y define rectangle to find averages
          Attention: coordinates from down, left picture
Line24:   Value Normalize cd/m2 Luminance graph (to the right last division)
Line25:   0, normal computation (reserved)


Results from executing the script:

Res.bmp:  bitmap file
picture in grey scale, with bars with the luminance intervals in the lower part (values in the numerical file)
The output res.bmp will have the same headings as the central picture dib1.bmp


Lumi.dat: ascii file output with numerical results:
         Average and standard deviations in the pictures, luminances,
          Average and standard deviations in the defined rectangles, RGB values and standard deviations,

Luminance values corresponding to each bar on the lower part of the output picture
First  bar values from 0 and first value in luminance (cd/m2),
second bar values from first and second, and successively

Values of luminance points indicated (average +/- 1 pixel, total 9) for the 3 pictures and for the central picture only
